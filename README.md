## Firrtl plugin for VS Code

**Note**:

Because lightweight code editors such as VS Code have weak language insight and analysis capabilities, it is recommended to use the [Firrtl plugin for Intellij platform](https://github.com/easysoc/easysoc-firrtl).

Grammar come from sublime syntax highlighting support by [codelec](https://github.com/codelec/highlight-firrtl) .
